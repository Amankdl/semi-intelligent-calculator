Following functionalities are added : 1) Add 2)subtract 3)Multiply 4)Division 5)LCM 6)HCF 7)palindrome validity and few others...you can simply ask "bro" like "hey bro, can you add 4 and 9 for me ?" or you can ask in any possible way..mostly "bro" will try to give you suitable output. :) I'm also a beginner so this is a very simple and minor kinda project for my other newbie friends. keep learning...
